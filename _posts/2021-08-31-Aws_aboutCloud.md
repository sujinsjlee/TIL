- 컴퓨터작업을 처리하는 방식
    - 전통적인 방식 : 내 컴퓨터에서 데이터를 처리 
        - With **traditional IT infrastructure**, you are responsible for the protection of your data, and it is easier to ensure that only approved personnel can access stored applications and data. 
        - **Physically connected to your local network**, data centres can be managed by in-house IT departments on a round-the-clock basis, but a significant amount of time and money is needed to ensure the right security strategies are implemented and data recovery systems are in place.
    - 클라우드 컴퓨팅 : 데이터처리가 클라우드(인터넷)에서 처리 
        - 인터넷으로 연결된 거대한 컴퓨터를 활용
        - **Cloud computing is an external form of data storage and software delivery, which can make it seem less secure than local data hosting.** 
        - Anyone with access to the server can view and use the stored data and applications in the cloud, wherever internet connection is available. Choosing a cloud service provider that is completely transparent in its hosting of cloud platforms and ensures optimum security measures are in place is crucial when transitioning to the cloud.
